    <p>
        <strong>- Wild hyacinth:</strong> This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky<br>
        outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies. Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have withered.<br>
        Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.<br>

        delicate in an old-fashioned way. But the pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily and rapidly, and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to watch this <br>
        perennial to make sure it stays in bounds. Tolerates shade well.<strong>**Warning: this plant is poisonous.**</strong> <br>
